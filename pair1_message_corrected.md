**🔨 Your Implementation Tasks:**
- **All 5 tickets above** - Complete networking stack from Physical through Presentation layers

### Integration Points with Other Pairs

**With Pair 2 (Satellite Mobility):**
- Real-time satellite positions for routing decisions
- Contact window predictions for transmission scheduling
- Link quality data for adaptive protocols

**With Pair 3 (GUI Visualization):**
- Live routing performance metrics
- Buffer utilization data for dashboard
- Algorithm comparison statistics

## 🚀 Development Priorities

### Critical Path Implementation Order
1. **Start with P1-001 (Physical Layer)** - Foundation for all communication
2. **Follow with P1-002 (Routing)** - Core network intelligence
3. **Then P1-003 (ARQ/Buffer)** - Reliability layer
4. **Next P1-004 (Session)** - State management
5. **Finish with P1-005 (Presentation)** - Data optimization

### Key Technical Requirements

**Performance Targets:**
- Link capacity calculations: < 1ms per contact
- Routing decisions: < 50ms per bundle
- ARQ operations: < 100ms retransmission delay
- Buffer operations: < 10ms per bundle
- Real-time support for 100+ satellites

**Integration Requirements:**
- Seamless integration with existing Bundle layer
- Real-time data feeds to Pair 3 visualization
- Contact-aware optimization with Pair 2 mobility

## 📋 Development Guidelines

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- **Write tests first** before implementing functionality
- **Target >85% coverage** per module (Bundle layer already at 93%!)
- Use existing `tests/test_bundle.py` as reference
- Run `make test` frequently during development

### Code Quality Standards
```bash
# Before committing, always run:
make all  # Runs format, lint, typecheck, test

# Individual commands:
make format    # Black code formatting
make lint      # Flake8 style checking  
make typecheck # MyPy type validation
make test      # Pytest with coverage
```

### API Documentation
**Important**: Create API documentation files in `docs/` for each implemented module:
- `docs/physical_layer_api.md`
- `docs/routing_algorithms_api.md`
- `docs/arq_buffer_management_api.md`
- `docs/session_management_api.md`
- `docs/presentation_layer_api.md`
